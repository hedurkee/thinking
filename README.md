I am a signal processing engineer at MIT Lincoln Laboratory working on over-the-horizon radar. I am currently taking classes in neural and cognitive science through the MIT Advanced Study Program. I received my undergraduate degree in Engineering Science from Smith College where. I was a research assistant in Susan Voss's lab working on "measurements of ear-canal geometry from high-resolution CT scans of human adult ears"(see the paper below).

I am broadly interested in auditory and speech processing and how computational analysis of neural data paired with neural network models can elucidate cortical processing.
