# hello world
I am a signal processing engineer at MIT Lincoln Laboratory working on over-the-horizon radar. I am currently taking classes in neural and cognitive science through MIT an advanced study program. I received my undergraduate degree in Engineering Science from Smith College where I was a research assistant in the Voss Lab. 

I am broadly interested in auditory and speech processing and how computational analysis of neural data paired with neural network models can elucidate cortical processing.
